# repo-tools
This repo contains random oneliners and scripts that people might find useful. 

The collection has been accumulating in Jim Procter's working tree since 2015 - and include scripts tailored for the way the Jalview's developers maintain branches, versions, and the Jalview JIRA Issue Tracker (https://issues.jalview.org)

You'll probably find the same one-liners on stack exchange, gists, and other places - apologies if you feel there are some unattributed scripts or license infringements - to the best of my knowledge all scripts are CC-0 unless otherwise stated.
